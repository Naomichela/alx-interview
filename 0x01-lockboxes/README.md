# Lockboxes

This project contains a Python script that determines if all boxes in a set of locked boxes can be opened. Each box contains keys to other boxes, and we start with the first box unlocked.

## Requirements

- Python 3.4.3
- vi, vim, or emacs editors
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files

- `0-lockboxes.py`: Contains the function `canUnlockAll(boxes)` which solves the problem.
- `main_0.py`: A test file to run different cases of the lockboxes problem.

## Usage

To run the program, make sure all files are executable, and run the `main_0.py` file:

```bash
chmod +x 0-lockboxes.py main_0.py
./main_0.py
